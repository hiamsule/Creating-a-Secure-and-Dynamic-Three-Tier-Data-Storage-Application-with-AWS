# Project-105 :  Creating a Secure and Dynamic Three-Tier Data Storage Application with AWS

üöÄ Creating a Secure and Dynamic Three-Tier Data Storage Application with AWS

I developed a three-tier data storage application using AWS. The application is dynamic and secure, capable of accepting input from users. I utilized various AWS services to build the application, including EC2, ELB, RDS, VPC, Route 53 and ACM. The data storage layer securely stores data for the application, making it scalable and reliable. The source code for the application is open source and accessible on GitHub.

üí° About my project
The project follows a three-tier architecture, utilizing AWS services to create a data storage application. The 1.Tier layer allows users to interact with the application. The 2. logic Tier layer handles the core functionalities of the application. The data storage layer is responsible for securely storing and managing data.

‚õÖ The project was developed using the following AWS services:
‚óΩ Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): I used EC2 to create and manage virtual machines for hosting the application, providing users with access to the application.
‚óΩ Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB): ELB balanced the incoming web traffic, ensuring the application operates reliably even during high traffic periods.
‚óΩ Amazon Auto Scaling (ASG): I implemented ASG to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances based on the traffic load, ensuring the application can handle varying demand.
‚óΩ Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS): RDS provided a scalable and reliable database for securely storing data required by the application.
‚óΩ Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM): I used ACM to manage SSL/TLS certificates, enabling secure connections to the application.
‚óΩ Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): VPC allowed me to isolate resources within the AWS network, creating private subnets to control resource access and manage network traffic.
‚óΩ Amazon Route 53: Route 53 managed domain names for the application, enabling the assignment of a custom domain to the application.

¬© Project source code
The source code for the project is open source and publicly available on GitHub.

üíØ Project benefits
Scalable: The application can easily scale to handle increasing traffic loads.
Reliable: The application is designed with high availability in mind, ensuring reliable performance.
Open source: The project's open-source nature allows users to access and customize the code to suit their specific needs.
Customizable: Users have the flexibility to customize the application as per their requirements.
Sustainable: Being developed and maintained by a community, the application is likely to remain sustainable over time.

‚úÖ Conclusion
Creating a scalable data storage app with AWS, utilizing services and open-source nature for enhanced appeal and adaptability.

üìçOptimize app performance and reduce latency with CloudFront caching. Use AWS Lambda to trigger actions on user inputs and leverage DynamoDB to store user data, enhancing app capabilities and responsiveness.
